## Cool Code! 

```
    <div class="hero">
        <span role="img" aria-label="Business People"> </span>
            </div>
            <!-- adding aria-label as a workaround for an alt tag for background image -->
```

<p> While trying to find a way to add alt text to the background image of the site, I came across an option to add aria-label to the html so it will be read by a screen reader, but while also not requiring a change to the css. The role of aria-label is that it will automatically be read by screen readers, essentially filling in an empty html element so it will work as alt text for a background image. Reference sited below.

<p>Execute the following commands in Terminal:

2. mkdir responsive-portfolio
3. cd responsive-portfolio 
4. git clone https://github.com/hannahpsmith1/responsive-portfolio.git 


### Helpful Hints
Within terminal there are several shortcuts you can take to auto-fill values which makes it easier and faster to go between directories:
*when changing directories (cd) you can tab over if you have the first few letters of the directory and it will auto-complete the directory you are trying to go into
*if you hit the up arrow it will bring back the last command you executed (this is helpful if you messed up the command and need to tweek it or if you want to execute the command again)
