          <div class="col-sm-12 offset-sm-0 "></div>
          <div class="page-header">
              <div class="header"><h2>About Me</h2></div>
              <hr>
          <article class="row single-post no-gutters">
              <div class="offset-sm-0">
                  <div class="image-wrapper float-left pl-2 pr-3">
                      <img src="Slack.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail "width="304" height="236">
                  </div>
                  <div class="single-post-content-wrapper">
                      <p>Hi, my name is Hannah Smith.  I am originally from the east coast.  I am from a small town in North East Connecticut, called Torrington.  It is most famous for being the birth place of John Brown the famous abolitionist. 
                        I got my bachelors degree in Geology from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  After that I worked in Oil and Gas in Midland, Texas from 2013 to spring 2015.  In the Spring of 2015 oil crashed and I transitioned into the tech sector.
                        I have since worked at Apple maps as both a map digitizer and in IT as a technical support engineer.  Most recently I was working as a QA and documentation engineer at a construction startup in Menlo Park, California, but was laid off due to Covid-19.
                        <br><br>
                        Pre-Covid, my hobbies included hiking and backpacking.  I also enjoy scuba diving.  The best spot I have been scuba diving in the world has been The Maldives in 2014.  
                      </p>
                  </div>
              </div>
          </article>
      </div>
```

<p> I got a portion of this code from stack overflow (see source 5 below) which was from bootstrap 4 on wrapping text around an image.  I was able to augment it to be able to wrap the image and content dynamically.  I had to add a header and sizing as well as change the paragraphs to be p tags (so they could be manipulated with styling) and define the dimensions of the image.

## Installation
<p>Execute the following commands in  (Or Gitbash):

2. mkdir responsive-portfolio
3. cd responsive-portfolio 
4. git clone https://github.com/hannahpsmith1/responsive-portfolio.git 


### Helpful Hints
Within terminal there are several shortcuts you can take to auto-fill values which makes it easier and faster to go between directories:
*when changing directories (cd) you can tab over if you have the first few letters of the directory and it will auto-complete the directory you are trying to go into
*if you hit the up arrow it will bring back the last command you executed (this is helpful if you messed up the command and need to tweek it or if you want to execute the command again)
